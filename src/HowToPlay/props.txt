Props
properties
parameter
arguments

function add ( a,b ){
    return a + b
}

In react, we use props to pass data between components

- pure function
is a function with no side effect


Rules of Interaction Between Components and Props
 - the value of the props should not change
 - a prop should only come from parent to child
 - a child should not give data to parent 

 Person == Parent 
 Well == Child
 Water = data
 rope = props
 bucket = function
